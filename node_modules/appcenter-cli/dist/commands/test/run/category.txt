Commands that upload and start test runs.

These commands can automatically create artifacts directory for supported test frameworks, or upload previously prepared artifacts.

The former approach - automatically creating artifacts directory - is simpler to use, but may require additional tools. For example, Xamarin UI Tests require either .NET Framework or Mono, and Calabash tests require Ruby and the Xamarin Test Cloud gem.

The latter approach - uploading previously prepared artifacts directory - does not require any other tools. It can be used in CI systems where tests are built and started from different machines.
